//variable banauni tarika comparae wit c inn js
/**
 * in c 
 * data_type variable_name = value ;
 * int age = 20;
 * 
 * in js 
 * let variable_name = value 
 * let age = 20
 * 
 * the only difference while creating the variable in c and js is dollar($) can be used as a special character 
 * let $name = "saugat"      ----> valid variable in js but not in c
 * 
 * 
 * in c we have to write the exact data type of data while creating the variable but in js we can use let every where
 *  const , int , float , char , double etc in c
 *  let , const in js
